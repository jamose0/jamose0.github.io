		<h1>James's Fractals</h1>

		<p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Fractals</a>
		are pretty fantastic. The most famous is a visualization of 
		the Mandelbrot set. However, fractals can be made many other
		ways. The following fractal is made as a byproduct of Newton's
		method:</p>
		<p>Fig. 0: Newton's method on the polynomial \(x^2-3\)</p>

		<p>(Soon we will see more interesting fractals)</p>

		<p>Newton's Method is based on linear approximations. We 
			can say that \(f(x) \approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)\).
			Suppose we want to find the value, \(x_1\), for which the
			tangent line to the curve of \(f(x)\) at \(x = x_0\) crosses the \(x\)
			axis. Since the equation of the tangent line at this point
			is \(y = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x_1- x_0)\), the value of \(x_1\)
			is (let \(y = 0\)):
			\[x_1 = x_0 - {f(x_0)\over f'(x_0)}.\]
			We have taken an initial guess, \(x_0\), and used it to approximate
			the root (our approximation is \(x_1\)). Now, the key is 
			to take this approximation and compute \(x_1 - {f(x_1)\over f'(x_1)}\).
			This yields \(x_2\), which is closer to the root. We do this over
			and over and \(x_n\) approaches the actual root as \(n\ \rightarrow \infty\).
			The idea is that we can successively make linear approximations
			and get closer and closer to the actual root. In general:
			\[x_{n+1} = x_n - {f(x_n)\over f'(x_n)}.\]
			Different starting guesses (\(x_0\)) may yield different roots.
			Note that Newton's method may behave chaotically or fail to converge (think critical points).
			This will not be discussed in detail here. See <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method".>Newton's Method</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Newton's method works exactly the same way for numbers that are not
			purely real (numbers with imaginary parts, such as \(2 + 3i)\). This
			is key in drawing fractals. Look back at Fig. 0 and think of it now
			as the complex plane. It spans from \(-1+i\) in the upper left to \(1-i\)
			in the bottom right. Each point in the plane is colored according to which
			root it causes Newton's method to converge to. We know that the roots
			of \(x^2 - 3\) are \(\sqrt{3}\) and \(-\sqrt{3}\). All points in the purple reigon
			of the graph cause Newton's method to converge to \(\sqrt{3}\) and all of the 
			white points cause it to converge to \(\sqrt{-3}\). Only one number causes
			Newton's Method to fail and that is \(x = 0\) because \(f'(0) = 0\) and 
			we would have to divide by zero.

		<p>Fig 1: Here is the Newton fractal for \(f(x) = x^3-3\). \(\frac{df}{dx} = 3x^2\)</p>
		<img src="fig1.png" \>
		<p>
			Note that \(x^3 - 3\) only crosses the \(x\)-axis once (at \(x = 3^{1/3}\)), but 
			there are three colors! By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">fundamental theorem of algebra</a>, this polynomial has
			three roots. Two of them have imaginary parts.

		<p>Fig 2: \(f(x) = x^4 + 10\) and \(\frac{df}{dx} = 4x^3\)</p>
		<img src="fig2.png" \>
		<p>Note that \(x^4\) crosses the \(x\)-axis <i>zero</i> times.</p>

		<p>Fig 3: \(f(x) = x^5 - 2x - 5\) and \(\frac{df}{dx} = 5x^4 - 2\)</p>
		<img src="fig3.png" \>
		<p>These images become interesting quickly!</p>

		<h3>In conclusion, math is art...</h3>
		<p>All of the images were generated by a program I wrote. It is included
